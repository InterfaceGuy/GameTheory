Game theory studies the strategies and dynamics within finite games with clear rules and goals, where players optimize their actions to succeed. A classic example is the prisonerâ€™s dilemma, where two criminals must decide whether to betray each other or cooperate, with the fear of betrayal often leading both to defect, demonstrating the complexities of strategic decision-making and coordination failure.
